### Part 4: Practice

/// type=CR, answer=[tests/ConnectingToDatabase/CreatePHPApplicationConnectingToPostgreSQLTest.php]

Write a PHP program that uses the `PDO_PGSQL` driver and `PDO` class to connect to the PostgreSQL database. First, assign the following variables with its respective values: `$host='localhost'`, `$db = 'MyDatabase'`, `$port = '5432'`, `$username = 'postgres'`, and `$password = 'Admin01'`. Then, set the `$dsn` variable that stores the `PDO_PGSQL DSN` statement which contains the elements `host`, `port`, `dbname`, `username`, and `password`. Next, add a statement that creates the `$conn` object an instance of the `PDO` class which passes the argument `$dsn`. Write the `if` statement to evaluate the `$conn` object inside the parentheses `()`. If the expression evaluates to `true` then, the `echo` statement displays the string `Successfully connected!`. Use the `try-catch` statement to evaluate the `if` statement. Set the `catch` block to display the error message `Unable to establish a connection` if there is a problem with the connection. Run the program to view the output.

```php
<?php


?>
```
