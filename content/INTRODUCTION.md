## PHP & PostgreSQL

PostreSQL is an open source object-relational database system and PHP is a scripting language designed for web development. This course will cover the basics of PostgreSQL programming with PHP Data Objects(PDO). For PHP and PostgreSQL to communicate it requires `PG PHP SQL extension`.

This course is designed for:

* Learners who have completed `PostgreSQL Introduction`, `PHP Introduction`, `PHP Intermediate`, `PHP Advance`, and `Object-Oriented Programming in PHP`.

* Individuals who have backgrounds in `PostgreSQL` and `PHP Programming`.

* Experience programmers who want to take a refresher.

Get to know more about how PostgreSQL database interacts with PHP Data Objects(PDO) API. Learn how to perform database operations in PHP such as querying data, inserting data, updating data, and deleting data. Work on various exercises and problems and write your own code. Go beyond learning the syntax and experience of how PostgreSQL PHP programming works.
