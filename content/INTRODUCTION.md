## Database Management in PHP

Database management in PHP lets you build PHP programs that define, construct, and manipulate a database with PostgreSQL. This course covers the basics of performing PostgreSQL programming in PHP. It requires `PG PHP SQL extension` for PHP and PostgreSQL to communicate.

This course is designed for:

* Learners who have completed `PostgreSQL Introduction`, `PostgreSQL Intermediate`, `PHP Introduction`, `PHP Intermediate`, `PHP Advance`, and `Object-Oriented Programming in PHP`.

* Individuals who have backgrounds in `PostgreSQL` and `PHP Programming`.

* Experienced programmers who want to take a refresher.

Get to know more about how PostgreSQL database interacts with PHP using PHP Data Objects (PDO) API. Learn how to perform database operations in PHP such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data. Work on various exercises and problems and write your own code. Go beyond learning the syntax and experience of how PostgreSQL PHP programming works.
